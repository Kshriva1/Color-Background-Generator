# Color-Background-Generator
A background generator website built using html, css and javascript DOM structure

You can view the website (here)[https://kshriva1.github.io/Color-Background-Generator/].

In this website I have:

1. Written code so that the colour inputs match the background generated on the first page load. 

2. Displayed the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load.

3. Added a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs.

If you press the random button, the color of the background changes.
