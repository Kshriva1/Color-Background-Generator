# Color-Background-Generator
A background generator website built using html, css and javascript DOM structure

You can view the website [here](https://kshriva1.github.io/Color-Background-Generator/).


This website initially has a default background. We can change the background using the two color selectors on the webpage. This webpage can be used in several projects and provides a good background.

This website has a random button which internally produces two random numbers to change the background colors.
